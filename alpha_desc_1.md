### Character System
- **Class-Based Framework**: Characters belong to distinct classes with unique abilities and progression paths
- **Stat System**: Core attributes (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, SPD) with derived stats (health, mana, AC)

- **Feat Hierarchy**:
  - Legendary Feats: Game-changing abilities that define character specialization
  - Major Feats: Significant enhancements to character capabilities
  - Minor Feats: Small bonuses and quality-of-life improvements
  - All feats can modify stats, grant new actions/reactions, or provide passive benefits

### Combat Mechanics

  - Heavy: Maximum protection with significant movement cost
- **Consumables**: Single-use items with immediate effects
  - Potions, scrolls, food, traps, bombs
- **Magical Items**: Equipment with passive and active abilities

### Terrain System
- **Hexagonal Voxel Grid**: Thin, stackable hex prisms for building 3D environments
- **Multi-Level Construction**: Caves, buildings, and complex structures
- **Terrain Types**: Various surfaces affecting movement and combat

  - Hazardous terrain causing damage or effects
  - Special terrain with unique interactions
- **Procedural Generation**: Algorithm-based terrain creation with customizable parameters
  - Biome-specific features and distributions
  - Natural formations like rivers, mountains, forests
  - Dungeon generation with rooms, corridors, and features
- **Environmental Effects**: Weather, lighting, and atmospheric conditions

### User Interface
- **Customizable Hotbar**: Quick access to frequently used actions
  - Keyboard shortcuts (1-0) for immediate execution
  - Visual cooldown and resource cost indicators
- **Character Sheet**: Comprehensive display of all character information
- **GM Dashboard**: Tools for world management and session control
- **Action Timing Tracker**: Records time between actions at 0.1s resolution
- **Stats and Achievements**: Comprehensive tracking of all character actions and milestones

### Technical Features
- **3D Camera System**: Bird's eye, orbital, and first-person perspectives
- **3D Dice Simulation**: Visual dice rolling with automatic calculation
- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Synchronized state across all connected clients
- **Session Recording**: Complete replay system for review and analysis
