I'm ready to start development - please help me implement this step by step, focusing on clean, modular code that follows best practices for Three.js and Socket.io. Let's begin with setting up the project structure and implementing the core hexagonal grid system.

All development will happen through remote SSH connection to a linux device (raspberry pi5), which will act as the server, so I am using use bash commands and VSCode for direct file editing. The parent directory is called DiscHex_Alpha.
